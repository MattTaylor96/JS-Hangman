# JS-Hangman

A hangman game built for learning purposes. The game allows the user to define the difficulty level (number of lives) and maximum word length, before giving them the chance to guess the word one letter at a time.

The game does not implement a seperate CSS document, as the focus was on the development of the functionality rather than the design of the application.
